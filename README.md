Large language model and small model collaboration for maize seed vigor detection
### Item Abstract ðŸ˜€
In this study, we propose a collaborative strategy integrating large and small model for maize vigor detection, with the additional capability of spectral reconstruction.

### Key Features :pencil2:
The specific contributions of this study are as follows:
1. A new framework combines large and small language models to improve computational efficiency and reduce hallucinations in large-scale models.
2. The approach boosts model performance, enabling vigor detection, spectral reconstruction, and key wavelength selection.
3. The relationship between embryo/endosperm spectra and seed vigor is explored, with two vigor-specific maize spectral datasets created, including phenotypic and physiological labels.
4. The maize vigor detection model's generalization is validated, showing strong stability across varied datasets and simulated noise conditions.
